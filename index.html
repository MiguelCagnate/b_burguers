          A fairly new player in the burger field in
          <em><b> Barcelona</b> </em>, but wow are we impressed. They do their
          own thing, and they do it well. Insane burgers with only the best
          ingredients, and you won’t leave hungry. Make sure to try El Don, an
          insane burger that comes oozing with smoky dry-aged beef, bacon and
          onion stew, confit mayo, and all.the.things. Want something seriously
          spicy? They’ve got that covered too. The restaurant deco is really
          cool, they have craft beer on tap, specialty coffee (!) from Hidden
          Coffee Roasters, and cocktails. Check, check, check. Read my review of

          around now for a few years, and they have created a name for
          themselves with their top-notch burgers and their “slow street food.”
          The pulled pork burger is a great option: the pork has been slowly
          roasted for 16 hours, and the house BBQ sauce is legendary. Keep an
          eye out for the seasonal Patty Melt that is one of the best sandwiches
          I have EVER had. They have craft beers on tap. Read my review of

      (Raval). Big Al’s - One of my absolute favorites. There is something about
      those curly fries that is simply irresistible. And the
      <em><b>burgers</b></em> are big and packed with flavor, topped with a
      perfect brioche bun. My weakness is the Fat Elvis: peanut butter, banana,
      bacon, and a meat patty. If you are a really, really big burger fan make
      sure to order the Widowmaker (good luck with finishing it). <br>They
      have craft beers on tap and a few American soda options such as Dr.
      Pepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read my review of Big Al’s here. Carrer de Córsega 178 (Eixample). The OG
      Big Al’s is located in Sitges. Barna Brew - I love this brewpub located in
      Sant Antoni. They brew their Belgian-Catalan style beers on site, AND they
      have good food to pair it with. Their burger is pretty impressive, with
      excellent quality malt bread, onion caramelized with malt, sweet and sour
      red cabbage, hop mayonnaise and spicy malt ketchup, Scamorza cheese and
      kumato tomatoes. Quite the burger, don’t you think? Read my review on

      <b id="vegan">Vegan Junk Food Bar</b> - A homage to plant based junk food!
      They have several great burger options, with awesome vegan bacon, a yummy
      burger patty, and delicious vegan cheese. Make sure to also try the very
      loaded nachos, and any of the cocktails. Carrer de Manresa 4 (Born).<br>

      <b>De Paula</b> - Sorry De Paula lovers, I know you want to keep this
      place a secret… But its is one of the best burger places in the city, so
      I’ve gotta share it! This Poble Sec gem is the favorite of many. One of
      the most popular burgers is the Copacabana: picanha meat, bread made with
      dark beer, and smoked mozzarella. Their bravas are also worth a try: they
      are made on the same grill as the burgers (not deep-fried). Carrer Creu
      dels Molers, 65 (Poble Sec).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Coure - </b>This high-end restaurant has a more informal bar with a
      very famous burger. It has all the standard ingredients, but the final
      result it’s close to perfection. Make sure to book in advance (and mention
      you’ll want a seat at the bar). Passatge Marimón 20 (Sarria-Sant Gervasi).

          are quite innovative! Only organic meat is used for their burgers. The
          pulled pork burger is a classic here, and their sweet potato bravas
          are worth adding to the order. Here they also know their craft beers,
          and you will find a range of rotating taps to choose from (ask for
          guidance from the knowledgeable staff). Read my review of Bar Centro

          grilled on the Josper. You can pair your tasty burger with a gin
          tonic, or any other cocktail you fancy. The place is cozy, and they

      <b>Rare Burgers & More -</b> Try the famed Beyond Burger, made with 100%
      plant-based beyond meat. The burger menu is short and sweet, but you can’t
      go wrong here, really. The fries are excellent, and the speculoos dessert
      is to die for. Carrer del Casp 55 (Eixample).

      <b>La Porca - </b> Poble Sec hides a few well-kept secrets, and La Porca
      has made a name for itself with their excellent sandwiches and burgers.
      One of the top sellers is the recently added Triple Porca that began as a
      seasonal sandwich but has turned into a fixed item on the menu: locally
      sourced pork, smoked bacon jam, bacon, raclette, and a secret sauce. Make
      sure to try their Bravas, they are very unique with slow-cooked tomato, a
      touch of chipotle, and with roasted pork on top. There are also a few
      specialties from Murcia to look out for. Read my review of La Porca here.

          entrance is just like an apartment and the bathroom is inside the

      <b>BRO Barcelona - </b>I’m a fan of this charming burger place in the

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bar Torpedo - </b> This fairly recent addition to the bar scene has
      surprised many a burger lover. The place is tiny (and cool), and the menu
      short, but the burger makes it all worth it. There is only one burger on
      the menu, but it’s all you need really. The meat used is excellent and the
      brioche bun just perfect. The owner is Rafa Peña from famed Gresca
      restaurant. Carrer Aribau 143 (Eixample).

    <p>
      <b>Acero Street Flavours - </b> This tiny, TINY place in the Born has an

      <b>Santa Burg -</b> A classic from the moment it opened, and one of my
      absolute favorites. I have a massive weakness for the foie with apple.
      They have two locations, one in Sants (more of a bar) and another one in
      Eixample (restaurant). Read my review of Santa Burg here. Carrer Valencia
      273 (Eixample) and Carrer Vallespir 51 (Sants).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Foc i Oli -</b>The Chivito is legendary: it’s not a traditional burger
      patty, instead they use thinly cut beef for this one. The sauces make
      these burgers very special. The place is tiny, but they are opening a
      second location in October. Carrer Aribau 91 (Eixample) and Carrer Paris
      177.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Anauco Burgers - </b>They are present in Madrid and

      (Eixample).

      <b>El Filete Ruso -</b>Organic meats and good quality ingredients on

      95 (Eixample).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Gringa - </b>This hip hangout is famed for their Taco Tuesday and their
      brunch, but the burgers are one of a kind too. Make sure to try the Fried
      Chicken Burger. Carrer de la Lleialtat 16 (Raval).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lomo Bajo - </b> This restaurant specialized in excellent quality meat
      divides into two: Lomo Alto which is a high-end restaurant and Lomo Bajo
      downstairs that offers dishes made with quality meats and ingredients for
      a more accessible price. You’ll be sure the burger is top-notch. Also, the
      steak tartar roll is very much worth trying. Carrer d’Aragó 283-285

    <h2>Recommendations...</h2>

      I asked my readers which ones are their favorites, and in addition to
      several of the restaurants above, they also mentioned these:
    </p>

    <p>
      Deja Burg - Go for the Piquillo with an Idiazabal cheese, and their
      excellent fries. There is a lunch menu option, and there are have
      gluten-free buns available. Carrer de Còrsega, 216 (Eixample).
    </p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.bacoaburger.com/en/" target="_blank">BACOA</a></h4>
    <p>
      <b id="bacoa">Bacoa -</b> A burger joint that has almost 10 years of
      experience, and has several spots in the city. The Cabrales burger is
      pretty impressive, with Cabrales blue cheese and caramelized onion. Here
      you can find a list of all of the Bacoa locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Oval</b> - This burger restaurant has been around for a while and
      remains a classic. Choose your bun, your patty, and the toppings. They
      have good suggestions on the menu too if you find choosing too tricky.
      Carrer Valencia 199 (Eixample).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Goiko Grill -</b> This is a chain of burger restaurants, but many of my
      readers claim it’s their favorite. I’ve tried their Kevin Bacon and liked
      it. Find all the Goiko Grill locations here.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Five Guys - </b> When I asked my readers to vote it ended up in the top
      of the list! I like the fact that it’s so versatile, and you can choose a
      lettuce bun instead of a normal bun. Find the Five Guys locations here.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Salt Restaurant & Beach Club</b> - In the W Hotel they make burgers
      that have charmed many a burger lover. Passeig del Mare Nostrum, 19, 21
      (Barceloneta).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>La Central -</b> Many chose La Central as their favorite burger bar,
      and while I haven’t tried the burgers myself, they look delicious. Vía
      Laietana 45 (Gotico) and Passeig del Born 29 (Born).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tio Joe -</b> Great for delivery, although the restaurant is cute too.
      They marinate the beef they use for their burgers for 48 hours. An
      interesting item on the menu is the wild boar ribs, served as a starter.
      They have a Thursday rice special worth checking out if you’re not feeling
      the burgers. Via Augusta, 9 (Sarria-Sant Gervasi).
